    """
    Retrieves and integrates up-to-date information on topics where recent events or developments (2024 onward) 
    are essential to accurately address the user's query.

    This function should only be called when the knowledge cutoff (01 Sep 2022) leaves gaps that would 
    prevent a comprehensive and accurate response. Retrieved insights should be directly relevant, carefully 
    vetted, and seamlessly incorporated with existing knowledge to provide a clear, precise, and well-informed answer.

    Args:
        query (str): The search query to retrieve insights for.
        top_k (int): The number of top search results to retrieve.

    Returns:
        str: A consolidated summary of insights derived from the search results.
